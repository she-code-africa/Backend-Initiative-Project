## Level Six Task: CACHING AND MESSAGING QUEUES (Redis, RabbitMQ)

Before I proceed, let me say, you deserve a standing ovation for having come this far and for your dedication. 
Congratulations on getting to L6.

YOU ARE A SUPERSTAR!💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽

### Task

For level 6, we want to make to make our app very fast and also to send notifications to your users.

To do that, you need to implement the following:
- Learn about and implement caching using any of the caching systems such as redis. You can cache all the get requests or the ones you feel the users would hit often. This will enable requests to be much faster, as they do not need to go all the way to the DB which takes a lot of time.
- For messages, implement a messaging queue to send notifications to users. This can be via email or sms. Messages may include:
  - Welcome message
  - Subscription messages
  - Expiry notices
  - Adverts, if subscribed 
  - Any other useful message you may think of
