# Backend-Initiative-Project
This is a base repository for the backend initiative project.

### Guidelines
1. Fork this repository.
2. By default you have a main branch and 12 other branch.
3. For each level task, checkout the branch with the name of that level. The link to the branch is what you will submit via [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSckJcKk0a3zAzQuaqNEM0gYY8zE6ox_gQ8zA9IvoXiNb3arYw/viewform).
4. Push changes.
5. After we assessed the task then we will do the needful and give adequate feedback.

## Please note: These are some of the things we are looking out for in your submissions
All links should be correct and publicly accessible. Ask for someone to help you check if you're not sure.

*Code Separation of Concern*: It is bad practice to have all code eg routes, models(data), controller in one file. It makes the file bulky and unmaintainable. See [@murewaashiruâ€™s](https://github.com/murewaashiru/Backend-Initiative-Project/tree/Level-Two-Task) github for guide on how to structure yours here. Endeavour to separate your code as your language permits.

Postman should have an example response that the consumer can look at. See sample [here](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/9925314/TVssj8nR)

Try as much as people to help out people in the channel, you can ask for who needs help or help someone who asks for help. This helps improve your grade and especially your helping(mentoring) skills.

Please do not submit for another level if you've not been graded for the previous level. You may start the task but please do not submit yet.

## Goodluck everyone and let's all have a wonderful week!!!!
