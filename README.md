WELCOME TO LEVEL FIVE

Your job, this time-around is to ensure users can make payment seamlessly on your platform.

- Ensure a user pays for his / her movie she is willing to rent.
- Ensure you validate payment
- Create a wallet that keeps track of users balance, movie records, etc.
- Create a transaction model that also keeps track of each money flow into the system i.e referencing the user, movie, payment, etc.

You may decide to add any other relevant feature  and also integrating all payment gateway😜
